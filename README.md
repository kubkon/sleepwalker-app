# sleepwalker-app

This repo contains a proof-of-concept iOS/WatchOS app for gathering intel on sleepwalking: possible causes, alleviations, what have you. As such, it should NOT be treated as a finished product. It's as far from it as literally possible.

NB the app requires iPhone and AppleWatch with the latest versions of software installed. To make it even worse, it also requires a compatible RESTful server on the receiving end. Well, I've written a simple example of such a server in Rust, and the source code can be found here: [simple-rest-api](https://github.com/kubkon/simple-rest-api).

## How to build it
Clone, get the latest version of XCode and off you go!
